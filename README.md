# Driver's Ed

Driver's Ed was a Flash game originally available on 
[MoFunZone.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20140802035132/https://www.mofunzone.com/games/driversed.html).
Adobe released an [announcement](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2017/07/25/adobe-flash-update)
on July 25, 2017 stating that it would ending support for Adobe Flash Player at 
the end of 2020. Adobe reasoned that open standards such as HTML5, WebGL, and
WebAssembly had matured to the point that they could be considered viable 
alternatives Flash Player, and that 3 years time would be sufficient to allow 
developers to migrate Flash content to newer standards.

I started this project on thinking that the original Driver's Ed game was no 
longer playable. It was only after recreating the driving physics, 
half of the assets, and most of exam logic, that I found out that the orignal 
version is still playable on many websites if you can download an old shockwave
plugin installer and run it inside a virtual machine. On that very same day I 
realized that the original game is playable on modern machines via the
[Flashpoint Archive](https://flashpointarchive.org/).

Still I don't consider any of the time that I've worked on this project wasted,
as it served as a great beginner project for learning how to use the Godot
Engine. I now consider this project somewhat of an HD remake, in the sense that
it's made for a higher resolution and is likely inferior to the original
otherwise.
