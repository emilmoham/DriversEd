# Driver's Ed

Driver's Ed was a Flash game originally available on 
[MoFunZone.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20140802035132/https://www.mofunzone.com/games/driversed.html).
Adobe released an [announcement](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2017/07/25/adobe-flash-update)
on July 25, 2017 stating that it would ending support for Adobe Flash Player at 
the end of 2020. Adobe reasoned that open standards such as HTML5, WebGL, and
WebAssembly had matured to the point that they could be considered viable 
alternatives Flash Player, and that 3 years time would be sufficient to allow 
developers to migrate Flash content to newer standards.

Many Flash games from the 2000's and 2010's were unable to be archived
or migrated and are unfortunately unplayable today. This project is an attempt 
to recreate the game from scratch in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) using 
the available video and screenshot references.
